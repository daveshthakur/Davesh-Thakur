## 🎨 Styling Approach (SASS)

- Variables used for colors, spacing, and layout values
- Logical grouping of styles by sections
- Clean nesting without over-complication
- SCSS compiled into CSS for browser compatibility

> Note: Browsers do not support SCSS directly, so the compiled `style.css` file is linked in `index.html`.
